She did not read the sign.
It was not snowing.
They had not cheered for France.
She had not been waiting for him.
They do not have a car.
He is not reading currently.
I have not been there.
He has not been beaten.
She has not been working hard.
It will not snow this winter.
They will not be traveling.
He will not have arrived.
You will not have been arriving by then.
