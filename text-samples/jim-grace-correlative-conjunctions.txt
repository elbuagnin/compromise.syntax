Both Jim and Grace tore up the place.
Either Jim or Grace lied to the priest. Neither Grace nor Jim spoke to his face.
Not only did they destroy but also they defiled the deceased.
Whether to forgive or not is the matter of this case.
Jim came home to relax, and Sally learned to play the sax (fyi, I don't know where Sally came from.)
Jim asked Sally, "how did you get so good?"
Sally has been practicing every day - that is what takes, don't you know?
