While riding a bike, I surveyed the country.
She drove the car, while I navigated.
While I sat there, she played the cello.
After the show, we sat outside.
After calling the venue, we bought tickets.
We drove after them.
Even after we called, they still ran out of tickets.
Even while riding a bike, I look my best.
Calling around, we were able to find the best prices, but then it rained and the show was canceled.
